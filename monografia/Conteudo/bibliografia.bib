   abstract = {Purpose - Within the building sector a lack of clarity in terminology does not help designers, clients or researchers. Non-domestic buildings have shown rapid increases in the use of advanced technology and control systems with varying drivers, many of which are labelled as intelligent. The term smart has been used interchangeably with intelligent without any clear distinction between the two. If the term Smart Buildings represented a separate, more advanced grouping, it would provide an opportunity to focus the future progress of non-domestic building development. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Drawing upon academic and industrial literature and experience, this paper reviews the scope of Intelligent Buildings and the current available definitions of Smart Buildings to form a clear definition of both smart and Intelligent Buildings. Findings - These definitions define the border between the intelligent and the (more advanced) Smart Building. The upper bound of the Smart Building is defined by (the future development of) the predictive building. Originality/value - This work provides a clear focus which will allow the progression of the non-domestic building sector by providing guidance and aspiration, as well as providing a platform upon which a large amount of technical work can be based.},

   abstract = {Within the last two decades, substantial amount of literature on intelligent building has been generated. However, there is a lack of systematic review of existing research efforts and achievements. A comprehensive review on existing research provides great benefits to identify where more efforts are needed and therefore the future research directions. For this purpose, this paper reviews the literature related to the subject area of intelligent building. Our review indicates that previous research efforts have dealt mainly with three research aspects including advanced and innovative intelligent technologies research, performance evaluation methodologies and investment evaluation analysis. It is also identified that among the three research aspects, relatively less literature has been found addressing the issues of investment evaluation of intelligent buildings. Based on a comprehensive literature review, the paper also summarizes a few future research directions, which are useful to researchers working in this important area. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

@article{croome2011,
   abstract = {Intelligent buildings need to be sustainable (i.e. sustain their performance for future generations), healthy and technologically up to date; meet regulatory demands; meet the needs of the occupants; and be flexible and adaptable enough to deal with change. Buildings will contain a variety of systems devised by many people, and yet the relationship between buildings and people can only work satisfactorily if there is integration between the supply- and demand-side stakeholders as well as between the occupants, the systems and the building. To achieve this, systems thinking is essential in planning, design and management, together with the ability to create and innovate while remaining practical (see Glossary). The ultimate objective should be simplicity rather than complexity. This requires not only technical ability but also the powers of interpretation, imagination and even intuition. Building Regulations can stifle creativity but are necessary to set a minimum level of expectation and obey health and safety requirements. However, we should aim at designing well above these conditions. After all, buildings form our architectural landscape and they, and the environment they generate, should uplift the soul and the spirit of those people within them as well as those who pass by them. The creation of shared visions, effective teams, clear structures and robust processes ensures that the intelligent building being constructed will demonstrate the purpose for which it was conceived. Times are changing as technology and society evolve, so there needs to be a long-term outlook by the team. Key innovation issues for intelligent buildings include sustainability (energy, water, waste and pollution), the use of information and communication technology, robotics, embedded sensor technology, smart-materials technology including nanotechnology, health in the workplace and social change. Smart materials in facades, for example, will provide sophisticated forms of feedback and high levels of control besides regulating thermal transmission. Eventually by coating and embedding materials with nanoparticles we will be able to specify material properties much more easily. Self-healing materials will revolutionize facades in the future. Pelletier and Bose (2010) describe how a concrete matrix embedded with capsules of sodium silicate healing agent can repair cracks by the sodium silicate from the ruptured capsules interacting with the calcium hydroxide in the concrete to form a gel that seals the cracks. However, innovation must be an enabler rather than an end in itself. Passive environmental design is equally important so that the energy demands are minimized by using natural means such as mass, orientation and building form to capture sunlight, fresh air and rain water. The intelligent buildings control markets are strong worldwide even after the gloomy economic period of 2009. The largest markets are in the USA, Asia, Middle East and Europe but some smaller countries are showing rapid growth. BSRIA Member e-News August 2009 shows that Scandinavia, Germany and Qatar spend most per capita on sophisticated intelligent controls. The increasing demand for sustainable, healthy and low-carbon intelligent buildings seems likely to sustain this dynamic market. Building management systems (BMSs) provide control and interoperability between the various systems servicing the building. Innovations such as internet-based, common, open communication standards and protocols increasingly make it more important to integrate the systems within intelligent buildings. This in turn will require an extended range of professional expertise that could force a cultural change. A key driver is the sustainability agenda. This article is about the actions and trends that are necessary to achieve a sustainable intelligent building. Such buildings need intelligent infrastructures and serve communities that demand new master planning approaches, and these will feature in a later special issue. © 2011 Derek Clements-Croome.},

@report{Berkoben2020,
   abstract = {Modern workplace physical environments have become an intersection of various systems mainly aiming to increase occupants comfort, safety, and productivity while reducing operational costs. In order to achieve such requirements, several systems installed in the workplace must be working optimally and in concert with each other. A typical workplace will have separate systems for HVAC, physical security, lighting, and fire control, and many others [8]. For large portfolios , it is usually necessary to have multiple management servers for each system. Each system may connect to hundreds of unique equipment types and variations which are often configured differently across installations. The lack of standardization even across similar equipment within the same system makes it very difficult to integrate and interpret data in order to understand the systems' behavior and provide value-added services for occupants and facility managers. The adoption of the Internet of Things promoted the connectivity of build-ings' sensors, devices and systems to the cloud. Such cloud connectivity is sustained by the ambition of promoting applications which will make use of the collected data. The aim is to rely on the gathered information to drive new business opportunities ranging from monitoring and visualization [8], [9], to energy peak shaving [5], and anomaly detection [12]. Connected things are of heterogeneous types and range from low-end devices such as sensors and actuators to more capable items such as systems which concentrate many devices. In such systems, contextual information of the connected sensors and gateways is organized and expressed more often in a convention or a notation such as the single-line diagram. In a given facility, different systems are usually deployed, such as a Building Management System (BMS) which monitors temperature, humidity and CO2 levels to regulate cooling and heating along with the indoor air quality. A Power Monitoring System is deployed in order to monitor power quality and power consumption of electrical loads often classified by usage such as lighting, heating, cooling and plug loads. Other systems are also deployed to collect presence data or to operate on lighting systems. These BMS systems supervise and control underlying controllers and devices, which support low level protocols such as BACnet [2], Modbus [10], and others. However, the commissioning process is very fragmented with its diverse tools},

This article systematizes fundamental concepts and requirements of BA systems, defining each aspect based upon established literature standards. Using these aspects as guidelines, the main BA technology specifications available are then reviewed with respect to their coverage of features. We then proceed by showing that none of the analyzed specifications are able to totally cover the expected standard functionality span of BA. Finally, we conclude that none of the existing approaches are able to fully overcome the problem of heterogeneity by satisfactorily addressing all the aspects of BA endorsed by the standards.},

A related and cost-effective user-level IoT application is the support of IoT-enabled smart buildings. Commercial space has substantial requirements in terms of comfort, usability, security, and energy management. IoT-based systems can support these requirements in an organic manner. In particular, power over Ethernet, as part of an IoT-based solution, offers disruptive opportunities in revolutionizing the in-building connectivity of a large swath of devices.

   abstract = {Nowadays billions of smart devices or things are present in Internet of Things (IoT) environments, such as homes, hospitals, factories, and vehicles, all around the world. As a result, the number of interconnected devices is continuously and rapidly growing. These devices communicate with each other and with other services using various communication protocols for the transportation of sensor or event data. These protocols enable applications to collect, store, process, describe, and analyze data to solve a variety of problems. IoT also aims to provide secure, bi-directional communication between interconnected devices, such as sensors, actuators, microcontrollers or smart appliances, and corresponding cloud services. In this paper we analyze the growth of M2M protocol research (MQTT, AMQP, and CoAP) over the past 20 years, and show how the growth in MQTT research stands out from the rest. We also gather relevant application areas of MQTT, as the most widespread M2M/IoT protocol, by performing a detailed literature search in major digital research archives. Our quantitative evaluation presents some of the important MQTT-related studies published in the past five years, which we compare to discuss the main features, advantages, and limitations of the MQTT protocol. We also propose a taxonomy to compare the properties and features of various MQTT implementations, i.e. brokers and libraries currently available in the public domain to help researchers and end-users to efficiently choose a broker or client library based on their requirements. Finally, we discuss the relevant findings of our comparison and highlight open issues that need further research and attention.},

   abstract = {In networked operating room environments, there is an emerging trend towards standardized non-proprietary communication protocols which allow to build new integration solutions and flexible human-machine interaction concepts. The most prominent endeavor is the IEEE 11073 SDC protocol. For some uses cases, it would be helpful if not just medical devices could be controlled based on SDC, but also building automation systems like light, shutters, air condition, etc. For those systems, the KNX protocol is widely used. We build an SDC-to-KNX gateway which allows to use the SDC protocol for sending commands to connected KNX devices. The first prototype system was successfully implemented at the demonstration operating room at Reutlingen University. This is a first step toward the integration of a broader variety of KNX devices.},

   abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is going to create a world where physical objects are seamlessly integrated into information networks in order to provide advanced and intelligent services for human-beings. Trust management plays an important role in IoT for reliable data fusion and mining, qualified services with context-awareness, and enhanced user privacy and information security. It helps people overcome perceptions of uncertainty and risk and engages in user acceptance and consumption on IoT services and applications. However, current literature still lacks a comprehensive study on trust management in IoT. In this paper, we investigate the properties of trust, propose objectives of IoT trust management, and provide a survey on the current literature advances towards trustworthy IoT. Furthermore, we discuss unsolved issues, specify research challenges and indicate future research trends by proposing a research model for holistic trust management in IoT. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {As cross-border access becomes more frequent, traditional perimeter-based network security models can no longer cope with evolving security requirements. Zero trust is a novel paradigm for cybersecurity based on the core concept of “never trust, always verify”. It attempts to protect against security risks related to internal threats by eliminating the demarcations between the internal and external network of traditional network perimeters. Nevertheless, research on the theory and application of zero trust is still in its infancy, and more extensive research is necessary to facilitate a deeper understanding of the paradigm in academia and the industry. In this paper, trust in cybersecurity is discussed, following which the origin, concepts, and principles related to zero trust are elaborated on. The characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses of the existing research are analysed in the context of zero trust achievements and their technical applications in Cloud and IoT environments. Finally, to support the development and application of zero trust in the future, the concept and its current challenges are analysed.},

   abstract = {The physical environment affects people's behavior and wellbeing. Some effects can be easily noticed through observation, whereas others require an in-depth study to be understood and measured. Although many alterations can be positive, some can also negatively influence wellbeing, decision-making, and mental and physical health. Some of these effects are not easily associated with physical space. Thus, people may be unaware of the real triggers for changes in behavior, mood, and wellbeing. Although many studies have been performed on environmental psychology, detailed research to understand the impacts of architecture on the brain using neuroscience is limited. Some difficulties experienced by researchers in this field are on the isolation of each stimulus to understand its effects individually and measurement of brain changes in people interacting with the environment because some brain scans, such as fMRI, require people to be inside the machine. Nonetheless, the several ways a space can impact its users should be discussed to understand how architecture influences individuals and to help architects and urban planners in designing efficient and healthy spaces. This study aims to describe and analyze the results of previous research works and propose a way of organizing them to facilitate further investigation on this field.},

	abstract = {Because human activities impact the timing, location, and degree of pollutant exposure, they play a key role in explaining exposure variation. This fact has motivated the collection of activity pattern data for their specific use in exposure assessments. The largest of these recent efforts is the National Human Activity Pattern Survey (NHAPS), a 2-year probability-based telephone survey ( n=9386) of exposure-related human activities in the United States (U.S.) sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The primary purpose of NHAPS was to provide comprehensive and current exposure information over broad geographical and temporal scales, particularly for use in probabilistic population exposure models. NHAPS was conducted on a virtually daily basis from late September 1992 through September 1994 by the University of Maryland's Survey Research Center using a computer-assisted telephone interview instrument (CATI) to collect 24-h retrospective diaries and answers to a number of personal and exposure-related questions from each respondent. The resulting diary records contain beginning and ending times for each distinct combination of location and activity occurring on the diary day (i.e., each microenvironment). Between 340 and 1713 respondents of all ages were interviewed in each of the 10 EPA regions across the 48 contiguous states. Interviews were completed in 63\% of the households contacted. NHAPS respondents reported spending an average of 87\% of their time in enclosed buildings and about 6\% of their time in enclosed vehicles. These proportions are fairly constant across the various regions of the U.S. and Canada and for the California population between the late 1980s, when the California Air Resources Board (CARB) sponsored a state-wide activity pattern study, and the mid-1990s, when NHAPS was conducted. However, the number of people exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in California seems to have decreased over the same time period, where exposure is determined by the reported time spent with a smoker. In both California and the entire nation, the most time spent exposed to ETS was reported to take place in residential locations.},

	abstract = {Purpose Within the building sector a lack of clarity in terminology does not help designers, clients or researchers. Non-domestic buildings have shown rapid increases in the use of advanced technology and control systems with varying drivers, many of which are labelled as intelligent. The term smart has been used interchangeably with intelligent without any clear distinction between the two. If the term Smart Buildings represented a separate, more advanced grouping, it would provide an opportunity to focus the future progress of non-domestic building development. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach Drawing upon academic and industrial literature and experience, this paper reviews the scope of Intelligent Buildings and the current available definitions of Smart Buildings to form a clear definition of both smart and Intelligent Buildings. Findings These definitions define the border between the intelligent and the (more advanced) Smart Building. The upper bound of the Smart Building is defined by (the future development of) the predictive building. Originality/value This work provides a clear focus which will allow the progression of the non-domestic building sector by providing guidance and aspiration, as well as providing a platform upon which a large amount of technical work can be based.},
